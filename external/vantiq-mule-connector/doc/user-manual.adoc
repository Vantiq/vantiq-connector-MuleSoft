= Vantiq MuleSoft Connector

The http://www.vantiq.com[Vantiq] https://www.mulesoft.com/[MuleSoft] connector provides bi-directional communication between Vantiq and the services exposed through MuleSoft.

== Dependencies

- [Vantiq connector common](https://github.com/Vantiq/vantiq-connector-common)

Note: The MuleSoft connector itself provides connectivity between Vantiq and MuleSoft. One or more adapters are required that define the specific data types and control actions associated with the services exposed through MuleSoft.

== Install

This connector consists of the following:

* Vantiq Anypoint Connector that provides the MuleSoft Anypoint side of the integration that allows Vantiq to participate in the Anypoint flows.
* MuleSoft Connector that provides support for the Vantiq side of the connector in the form of a Vantiq Rule. More information on Vantiq adapters and connectors is available https://dev.vantiq.com/docs/system/integration/overview/index.html#vantiq-adapters-and-connectors[here].
