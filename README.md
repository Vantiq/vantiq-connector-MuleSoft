# Vantiq Anypoint Connector

The Vantiq connector provides integration with the Vantiq platform.

Data and messages can be published to Vantiq from Anypoint using `publishData`.  DataSense is supported that provides metadata of the Vantiq data types into Anypoint.  The data is published into Vantiq and is expected to be handled by the *Vantiq MuleSoft System Adapter*.

The `selectData` source can be used to periodically poll Vantiq for data based on a specific query.

# Mule supported versions

Mule 3.5+

# Installation 

For beta connectors you can download the source code and build it with devkit to find it available on your local repository. Then you can add it to Studio.

For released connectors you can download them from the update site in Anypoint Studio. 
Open Anypoint Studio, go to Help → Install New Software and select Anypoint Connectors Update Site where you’ll find all avaliable connectors.
