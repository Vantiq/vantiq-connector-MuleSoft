=== Migrating from Older Versions
////
optional
If you’re currently using connector <old_connector_version> to migrate to this connector you need to:

- <step_1>
- <step_2>

If you’re currently using a connector version <old_connector_version_2> this connector is not compatible. Don’t upgrade to this connector unless you are sure you do the following:

- <step_3>
- <step_4>

<Step_1 to N should be clear instructions that pertain to the migration path from one connector to the other.
////

//Examples might include

//- Specifying which version of the runtime is needed for the new connector
//- Changes in the version of the connected systems to be able to work
//- When the connector suffers structural changes (i.e monolythic connectors now many update sites) we should also inform the split and why and how to update from one to //the other.
//- Specific instructions if the connector is running in CloudHub (like changing the Mule Runtime version, etc)
//- The first list of steps is for in-place upgrades, probably just updating via Maven or  Anypoint Studio  and re deploying.
//- The second list is for the connectors that are older and require additional steps.
//- Some of this might not apply (i.e. a connector is backwards compatible with all released versions or there is no previous version)


=== Features

. Publishing Data - Ability to publish data into specific Vantiq data types
. Publishing Messages - Ability to publish messages to Vantiq rules
. Subscribing to specific actions - Ability to trigger messages from Vantiq actions
. Subscribing to events - Ability to trigger messages from Vantiq type and topic events
. Subscribing to query - Ability to trigger messages from Vantiq based on query
. DataSense Support - Populates metadata from Vantiq data types

=== 1.0.2 Fixed in this Release

//- <Bug_Title> - <Conditions under which the bug used to happen, explain which was the result, which is now the fixed result>

//Example of a Bug listing:

//- Asyncronous processing now works when invoking via an External interface - Previously, when invoking an asyncronous service, the call could end up in a deadlock unless //lock(object) was used. Now, the connector locks automatically and you don’t need to do it.

//Example of what is NOT A BUG listing

//- Fixed CLDCONNECT-XYZ (because projects are not public)
//- Functional tests XYZ now work (because functional testing or any other part of the development process is not visible to customers)
//- Increased Sonar coverage (ditto)
//- Resolved NPE (lacking information like scenarios under which it can be reproduced, what is NPE, etc)

=== 1.0.2 Known Issues

No known issues.
